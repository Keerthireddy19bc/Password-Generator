# Password-Generator
It is a tool that generates passwords based on the given guidelines that you set to create an unpredictable strong password for your accounts. The Password generator tool creates a random and customized password for users that helps them to create a strong password which provides greater security.

- To create a password with Python, we need to create a program that takes the length of the password and generates a random password of the same length apart from this our program also generates as many passwords as we want with same length.

## ðŸ“ŒPython Program to Generate Password

- To write a Python program to create a password, declare a string of numbers + uppercase + lowercase + special characters. Take a random sample of the string of a length given by the user

**Code:**

    import random
    print('Welcome to our Password Generator')
    print('=================================')
 
    chars ='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!@#$%^&*?0123456789'

    number =input('Amount of Password generate: ')
    number =int(number)

    length =input('Enter the length of Password Generate: ')
    length =int(length)

    print('\nhere is your Password')
    for pwd in range(number):
        Passwords =''
        for c in range(length):
            Passwords += random.choice(chars)
        print(Passwords)
        
**Output:**

    Welcome to our Password Generator
    =================================
    Amount of Password generate: 5
    Enter the length of Password Generate: 8

    here is your Password

- In the above code, I first imported the random module in Python, then I asked for user input for the amount of the password he/she want. After that I asked for user input for the length of the password. Then I use a for loop here which should run as many times as many times we want amount of password generated.

- Then in the for loop I created a variable named as "Passwords" and define it with blank string. Then again I'm using a for loop here which should run as many times as length of password we want. After that I stored the letters, numbers and special characters that I want to be considered while generating a password which will finally generate a random password and prints it.
